# PCprophet

Software toolkit for protein complex prediction and differential analysis of cofractionation mass spectrometry datasets.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you to obtain a copy of the project, to run on your local machine, and to test the compatibility with your current Python packages.
### Dependencies

* [Python >=3.4.x](https://www.python.org)
* [Sklearn 0.23.2](https://pypi.org/project/sklearn/)
* [NetworkX v2.4](https://networkx.github.io)
* [Pandas >=1.23](https://pandas.pydata.org)
* [Scipy >=1.5.2](https://www.scipy.org)
* [Dask >=2.30.0](https://dask.org)

### Installing

We recommend using [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) as it contains the majority of the required packages for PCprophet. If you are using Windows and having problems adding paths of anaconda and Python, please click [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-anaconda-windows) for guidance. Please also refer to this [page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54063285/numpy-is-already-installed-with-anaconda-but-i-get-an-importerror-dll-load-fail) for potential errors when importing python packages in Windows.

#### Command line version

Ensure that you have installed the GitHub tool and 'git-lfs' command specifically for large file transfer. Please see [here](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03) for installing GitHub and [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage) for the installing 'git-lfs' command.

```
git-lfs clone https://github.com/anfoss/PCprophet PCprophet
```
This will get you a working copy of PCprophet into a folder called PCprophet.
